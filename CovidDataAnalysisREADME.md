# Description:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease was first discovered in Wuhan China in December 2019. Concerted efforts were made by the World Health Organization in keeping track of data generated during these period. These data basically consist of infection count, death count, population and vaccination rates in several countries and continents of the world. 
This project reveals the countries/continents mostly affected by the disease. From this analysis, we can also see how countries were able to manage the spread of the virus by looking at the infection count rate, death rate, vaccination rate and their population.
